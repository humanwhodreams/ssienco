Over the course of using Tailwindcss a lot, I realised I always find myself guessing breakpoints for screensizes. I do not mind the hassle but as time went on I would have to go back between my browser and project figuring out the responsive aspect of my app. I am sure you are tired as well.

I came across a really handy component from [Shadcn](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/components/tailwind-indicator.tsx). A tailwind indicator component that displays the current breakpoint of the viewport. I then added my own add-ons for more information.

The screen sizes include.

| Screens | Alias         |
| ------- | ------------- |
| xs      | extra-small   |
| sm      | small         |
| md      | medium        |
| lg      | large         |
| xl      | extra-large   |
| 2xl     | 2 extra-large |

The indicator is only shown in Nodejsâ€™s development mode and is hidden in production. Use the `NODE_ENV` for your project's framework. I am using Next.js.

```ts
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') return null;
```

The final component code should look something like this.

```tsx title="tailwind-indicator.tsx"
export function TailwindIndicator() {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') return null;

  return (
    <div className="fixed z-50 flex items-center justify-center h-8 px-3 text-xs font-medium rounded-md bottom-1 left-1 border">
      <div className="flex items-center sm:hidden">extra-small &mdash; xs</div>
      <div className="items-center hidden md:hidden sm:flex">
        small &mdash; sm
      </div>
      <div className="items-center hidden md:flex lg:hidden">
        medium &mdash; md
      </div>
      <div className="items-center hidden lg:flex xl:hidden">
        large &mdash; lg
      </div>
      <div className="items-center hidden xl:flex 2xl:hidden">
        extra-large &mdash; xl
      </div>
      <div className="items-center hidden 2xl:flex">
        &gt;2 extra-large &mdash; 2xl
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The indicator is placed at the bottom left of the application. It can be adjusted by tweaking the css `positions` which are top, bottom, left, and right.

Happy coding. ðŸª¶
